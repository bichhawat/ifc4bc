The project is focussed on implementing information flow control in WebKit, which includes changes to the JavaScript engine, the DOM and the event-handling mechanism. Additionally, we support a mechanism to specify policies that the browser would enforce. The work was presented as part of three papers:
[Information Flow Control in WebKitâ€™s JavaScript Bytecode](https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-54792-8_9)
[Information Flow Control for Event Handling and the DOM in Web Browsers](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7243745/)
[WebPol:Fine-grained Information Flow Policies for Web Browsers]()
